Welcome to **Vocal Bootcamp**! 🎵 This app is your personal vocal coach, ready to provide custom warm-up routines based on your voice type and goals. Whether you're a Soprano, Alto, Tenor, or Bass, we've got you covered with audio examples and tailored routines to help you hit those high notes or deepen your low tones.

## 🧐 What's the Problem?

Many vocalists struggle with figuring out the right warm-ups to improve their skills. Enter Vocal Bootcamp: your solution for guided, instructional warm-ups designed to enhance your vocal prowess.

## 🌟 The Solution

Vocal Bootcamp generates personalized warm-up routines in various categories, giving vocalists the resources they need to improve. From scales to breathing exercises, you'll have everything you need to shine on stage.

## 🛠 How I Built This

This project kicked off during my time at Nashville Software School. We were tasked with developing a front-end web application using React. As a full-time music teacher, I saw firsthand how challenging it was to assign effective warm-ups to my students weekly. This app became my way to simplify and enhance that process.

## 🧭 Navigating the Project

- **Custom Warm-Ups:** Tailored routines based on voice type.
- **Audio Examples:** Hear exactly how each warm-up should sound.
- **Notes:** Keep track of your progress and feedback.

## 🤔 Why This Approach?

Balancing a busy teaching schedule and ensuring students had appropriate warm-ups was tough. An app that provides customized routines and note-taking capabilities seemed like the perfect solution to keep everyone on track and improving.

## ⏳ Future Enhancements

If I had more time, I would:

- **Refine the Styling:** Make the interface even more user-friendly with a draggable widget design.
- **Backend Admin Interface:** Allow teachers to upload more audio warm-ups, manage student accounts, and tailor the app even further to individual needs.
